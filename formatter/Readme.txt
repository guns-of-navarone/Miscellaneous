Lets say you copied a bunch of XML from your terminal into the clipboard. So, you've got 100 lines of N characters each, but that doesnt make for good reading. Run the XML formatter to break it up into readable XML.

Sample xml of 80 character width, in ex.xml, sourced from: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms762271(v=vs.85).aspx
The output XML will be in a file output_XXX.xml generated in the same folder.
